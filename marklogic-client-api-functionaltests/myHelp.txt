Step 1:  Build dev source code by doing the following on your dev branch 
~/java-client-api$
mvn clean
mvn compile
mvn –Dmaven.test.skip=true install

Step2:   Go to the test complete directory 

~/java-client-api/test-complete$
 gradlew clean
 gradlew test    => to run all the functional tests, which will take about couple of hours
 gradlew -Dtest.single=TestBulkWriteMetadata1 test    => to run individual tests

Step3:  Each test is independent and you can find the results under 
~/java-client-api/test-complete/build/test-results

and if you run all the functional tests then you can find a report under 
~/java-client-api/test-complete/build/reports/tests/index.html
