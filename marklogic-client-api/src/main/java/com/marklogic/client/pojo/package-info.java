/**
 * The goal of this package (sometimes referred to as "the pojo facade" is to simplify working
 * with custom Plain Old Java Objects (pojos) without hassling with persistence details.
 * {@link com.marklogic.client.pojo.PojoRepository} simplifies create, read, update, and delete
 * (CRUD) operations on custom pojos. {@link com.marklogic.client.pojo.PojoQueryBuilder} keeps 
 * all the powerful queries available via StructuredQueryBuilder while enabling queries across 
 * objects persisted using PojoRepository.
